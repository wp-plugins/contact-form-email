###Why you should use a contact form

If you don't have a contact form on your site now, you may think a contact form is not necessary.  You may think you don't need a contact form because you don't have a lot of visitors to your site.  You may also think a contact form is not necessary because you don't think anyone wants to contact you.

Both of these reasons are wrong assumptions.  You need a contact form on your site.  No matter how little your traffic, you should have a contact form from the moment you start your site.  Real people are coming to your site and they want to contact you.  You need to give them the oppurtunity with a contact form.

The Wordpress Contact Form plugin allows you to collect the basic information you need.  The contact form provides a place for name, email address, subject, and message.

You should collect a visitor's name on your contact form because you want to personalize the communications you send back to them.  Personalizing messages can get a better response rate than not personalizing them.

Of course it goes to say that you will collect the visitor's email address on your contact form.  You need the email address to be able to contact them back.
